                <h2>Artist: Wendy Barben Dimick</h2><br>
                <p>Wendy Barben Dimick has been a high school art teacher in Utah for 33 years. She teaches drawing, painting, sculpture, and pottery classes. Art is her passion and what makes her tick. She strongly believes that creativity is one of the key components to HAPPINESS. People need to create every day, whether it is with food, plants/gardening, music, or other. Art is such a healthy outlet. She rarely goes a day without picking up pencils and a paint brush. She uses all mediums (chalk pastels, oil pastels, colored pencils, markers), but likes acrylic and watercolor painting the best. This book is created with Prismacolor brand colored pencils.</p>
                <p>When she is not teaching school, she paints murals, portraits, and oversized clocks (4’ – 6” in diameter), and lots of personalized cornhole game sets. Her murals have been featured in the Parade of Homes, restaurants, schools, and many other businesses. A few years back, she and her students painted 18 of the life-size horses that are on display every summer in Ogden, Utah on 25th street from April-October. Each horse is sponsored by a business and has a theme advertising their goods. They covered the horses from top to bottom (both sides!) with paintings that promoted the themes. A few other student/teacher projects include paintings of A10’s and F16’s for Hill Air Force Base, creepy back drops for haunted houses, scenery for school musicals/plays, tomb stones for Red Ribbon weeks, etc.</p>
                <p>Besides ART, Wendy really enjoys running, hiking, biking, swimming, snowboarding, boating, travelling, waterskiing, playing the piano, going to 80’s concerts, and more. She has run 20+ full marathons, 30+ half marathons, and a few triathlons. She loves the “high” that she gets from outdoor activities and her art. She is blessed with 4 active, successful children who are very supportive of all her creative, eccentric projects.</p>
